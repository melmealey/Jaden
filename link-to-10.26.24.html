    <h2>October 26, 2024 - Bicycle Safety</h2>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>I am learning so much from my time here at the MTC! I love all the resources that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints provides such as Safety Zone videos! The Safety Zone is an educational space where missionaries can learn how to be situationally aware, obedient, 하고 (and) respectful on their mission. Even though I will not be riding a bike reguarly on my mission, I am grateful for the advice given. </p>
    <p>I love the MTC schedule! </p>
    <p>A short run down:</p>
    <p>- I wake up at 6:30 am</p>
    <p> - I study personally for an hour</p>
    <p>- Elder Christensen (my companion) 하고 I eat breakfast</p>
    <p>○ Elder Christensen is from California, 20 minutes away from the beach, Disneyland 하고 the Temple! He loves to sing, dance, talk about Korean dramas, play sports 하고 perform in musicals! </p>
    <p> Quick story! On P-Day's we have one class. Today we had a substitute! His name is Han 형제님 (Brother)! We learned about using an assumption tense 하고 how to tie this grammar form into sharing doctrinal messages. Before class ended, Han 형제님 introduced us to a fun game he made! The game was Super Mario themed which was awesome! In the game, our district was split into three teams. We took turns picking a letter A 통해 (through) Z, which looked like the yellow question mark blocks from Super Mario Bros! Each block had a different question we would have to translate in English or answer in Korean. Here's the twist! Once answered correctly, we got to choose whether to keep the box or give the box to another team! To win we had to have the most points by the end! I had so much fun!</p>
    <p>Back to my schedule:</p>
    <p>- After breakfast, Elder Christiensen 하고 I love to play volleyball! This past Friday, our district leader challenged us to only speak Korean until dinner time. I had so much fun having to communicate with other Missionaries on the court, playing charades when necessary.</p>
    <p>I would love to go more in depth though I'm short on time!</p>
    <p>Love,</p>
    <p>Mealey 징로 (Elder)</p>
