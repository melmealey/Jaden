    <h2>12-8-2024 - Have a 스플렌더 (Splendor) of a Time!</h2>
    <p>안영하세요~~! (Anyeonghasaeyoooooo!, helloooooo!)</p>
    <p>Today the church is broadcasting a Christmas Devotional! If you haven't had the chance to listen, I highly recommend listening to the devotional!</p>
    <p>Turns out South Korea was under Martial Law for a day! We had to stay indoor all day 하고 (hago, and) into the next day! I was on exchanges at the time with Gabune 장로님 (Janglonim, Elder)! He is from the Phillipines! Him 하고 세길에 (Saegirae, Seguirre) 장로님 speak Tagolog to each other! On 목요일 (Mokyoir, Thursday) we were given permission to go outside! I met back up with 제 동반자 (Jae Dongbanja, my companion), 네버스 (Naebeoseu, Nevers) 장로님! The next day, we went door knocking together! We got to take turns talking to people who answered! So much fun! We also made 쿠키들 (kukidur, cookies) 하고 gave them out to friends! One 회장님 (Hwehjangnim, brother) invited us to have 저녁 식사 (Jeonyeok shiksa, dinner) with him! I ate small fish with their teeth, eyeballs 하고 벼들 (byeodur, bones) which was delicious! I also tried water with burnt rice, not my favorite, next time I will tell myself the dish is pink 하고 sweet! Hopefully I like this dish then!</p>
    <p>The next day the relief society invited us to their party! 잘 먹었습니다 (Jar Meokeossumnida, We ate well!)! They had spaghetti, 수시 (Sushi, Sushi), 김치 (kimchi, kimchi), cookies, 하고 so much more! After that, 우리는 (Urineun, we) had the opportunity to teach 영어 수업 (Yeongeo sueob, English class)! We had 11 people attend, 하고 got to split the class into beginner 하고 intermediate levels! We facilitated the beginners class with the 자매님들 (Jamenimdur, Sisters)! We taught how to sound out the letters B 하고 F! We had them come up with words that started with these letters, 하고 had volunteers read tongue twisters, such as Betty Botter! At the end, anyone who is willing to stay can hear us talk about Jesus Christ! Elder Nevers 하고 I gave the 영적이 문자 ( Yeongjeoki munja, spiritual message)! </p>
    <p>On 일요일 (Iryoir, Sunday), we had choir practice! We have a competition this 토요일 (Toyoir, Saturday) against other 와드들 (Wahdeudeur, wards)! After church we had our personal studies! We dropped off cookies 하고 proslyted via stickerboarding! Stickerboarding is a fun way for people to come up 하고 place a sticker on what part of Enlgish is the hardest to learn! Afterwards we tell them about the free Enlgish classes we offer! </p>
    <p>Today Elder Nevers wanted to go to the church to work on his College Scholarships! Hopefully he gets a lot! The other Elders 하고 I played a board game called Splendor. If you haven't played, I highly recommend playing!</p>
    <p>While studying in Moroni 7, I highlighted verses 47-48! Moroni emphasizes the importance of being filled with charity, which is the pure love of 예수 그리스도 (Yehsu keuliseudo, Jesus Christ) 하고 praying with all our energy to Heavenly Father! I know Moroni is a prophet of God! I know that with charity 하고 sincere prayer we can be purified like Jesus Christ!</p>
    <p>사랑 (Sarang, Love),</p>
