    <h2>Novermber 16, 2024 - Last Week in the MTC!!</h2>
    <p> Hello!</p>
        <p>I received my flight info on Friday! I have to be at the travel office, at 3:30 am MT!  I'm flying from Salt Lake City to Seattle at 8:00 am, 하고 then from Seattle to Seoul South Korea from 10:35 am to 4:15 pm! </p>
        <p>How to be a Successful Missionary:
            This week's topic is, 'Exercising 허고 Eating Healthy!' These principles can apply to everyone.
            - Make sure you are getting enough sleep
            - Limit sugar
            - Fill nutrition with vitamins!
            - Exercise!
            - Be productive with free time</p>
        <p>This week I have been creating basic sentences using korean terms during my language study time. While creating the sentences I ran into a road block. That road block was knowing which "Glue" to use. After asking questions in class, I found out where I could learn more 하고 began studying. Turns out there a few rules for how 하고 when to use them. Practicing using glue in my sentences was a lot of fun!</p>
        
        <p>Favorite word I learned this week is 은사! This word means, "gift"! Hearing this word makes me think of a wonderful gift we have been given; The Book of Mormon! I am so grateful that this year the Come Follow Me is focused on studying the Book of Mormon! I love the questions I can take into my studies!</p>
        
        <p>A new thing I tried this week was playing four square during exercise time! I had so much fun!</p>
        
        <p>How has this week been a blessing to you 하고 those around you? I know I have been blessed with such wonderful friendships as my district strives to prepare for teaching in South Korea!</p>
        <p>Love,</p>
        <p>밀리 장로</p>
