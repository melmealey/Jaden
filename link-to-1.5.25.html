    <h2>DATE-TITLE</h2>
    <p>Hellooooo!</p>
    <p>Happy New Year! 2025 came so quickly! </p>
    <p>Our Mission President announced tranfers on Saturday. I found out that I am staying in Gangbuk! My trainer Elder Nevers is going to Wonju. I get to see him for 4 more days! I found out my new companion and trainer is going to be my grandfather, or my trainer's trainer! He is a native missionary from Busan so I am very excited! </p>
    <p>This week we had lots of people show up to English Class! We taught them simply about the letter "L" and introduced them to Hangman and Unscramble! </p>
    <p>Sunday was Fast Sunday and we got snow! In the morning, the Elders helped clear the snow outside the church. In the evening we went door knocking. Afterwards or bishop and his wife invited us over to enjoy a meal with them; we had kimchi stew! I found out he served in the military when he was younger and he has a daugther studying electrical engineering at BYU Provo! </p>
    <p>Today was district P-Day! We got McDonalds for lunch, went to a fishing cafe; I caught three fish and won a night light! We went to the church and played jungle UNO and BoyScouts with fun snacks! </p>
    <p>Spiritual thought: Sermon on the Mount! (Matthew 5-7 and 3 Nephi 12-14)</p>
    <p>I really like the words Jesus Christ teaches! I highly recommend studying these chapters! I know that by obeying God's commandments we will find comfort and strength!</p>
    <p>Love,</p>
    <p>Elder Mealey</p>
