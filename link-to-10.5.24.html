    <h2>October 5, 2024 - Studying Korean Outside</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>I am having such a great time at the MTC!</p>
    <p>I love my district!</p>
    <p>I love my teachers! Shout out to Sister Elias for having her birthday last Friday! Her substitute teacher was her boss and he was awesome! He can speak korean really fast and he is so much fun to be around. He taught us some polite behavioral customs through a silly video. I also learned how to introduce myself and ask questions such as there name and where they are from.</p>
    <p>Today is general conference! We got to watch via broadcast! I loved that the children got to sing in the second session!!</p>
    <p>Getting ready to enjoy a cinnamon roll! Shout out to my companion's mother for sending them for us to enjoy as a district!</p>
    <p>This week has been awesome!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Love, Elder Mealey</p>
