    <h2>12-15-2024 - 영감 (Yeongkam, Inspiration)</h2>
    <p>안녕 하세요~~! (Annyeong haseyooooo, Helloooooo)</p>
    <p>If you were a part of the Christmas Nativity, who/what would you want to dress up as?
        Personally, I would want to be a camel!</p>
    <p>Spiritual Thought:</p>
    <p>Moroni 10:5</p>
    <p>I know Heavenly Father can answer all of our questions through the Holy Ghost!</p>
    <p>I am really grateful for sacrament meeting! This past Sunday, I felt inspired to start speaking korean as often
        as I can! I was feeling concerned about talking to others in korean. I felt inspired to start speaking korean
        while pondering in sacrament meeting. I know this will help me grow more comfortable in the language. I know
        that Heavenly Father is aware of our questions! Through patience, 하고 (hago, and) earnest searching the Holy
        Ghost will help us find answers! Speaking korean brings me so much happiness! </p>
    <p>I invite you to ponder upon the symbolism behind the sacrament! I promise you will find peace 하고 hope when
        attending sacrament meeting!</p>
    <p>We went to a fun clothing joint! I got some fun pictures with clothes I liked!</p>
    <p>Love,</p>
