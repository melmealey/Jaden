    <p>안영하세요~~! </p>
    
        <p>Questions; When do you like to start playing Christmas music? Favorite Christmas song?</p>
        <p>I enjoy listening to Christmas music in the month of December. My favorite Christmas song is Domonick the Donkey!</p>
        <p>I enjoy making snow art, playing snowball, and snowboarding!</p>
        <p>Let me introduce my new companion! His name is Elder Nevers. He is from Provo, Utah. He has 9 people in his family! He likes to play soccer, and before learning Korean he was learning Chinese! I am rooming with him, Elder Segurrie who is from the Philippines, and his companion, Elder South, who was in my district back in the MTC!</p>
        <p>Spiritual Thought: </p>
        <p>1 Nephi 3:7 </p>
        <p>"I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded me."
            Nephi has such great faith to obediently act upon his father's commandments after they had been carrried out in to the wilderness. I know that through obedience to our parents, we can find great success and peace.</p>
        <p>Word of the Day:</p>
        <p>사명 which means mission. After Laman had failed to retrieve the plates, he wanted to go home. Nephi was courageous, and said they would not return back to their father until they had retrieved the brass plates. Through his faith, Heavenly Father provided means in which he was able to retrieve the plates. I know that all of us have a 사명 from Heavenly Father. I invite us to ponder upon what that mission may be and how we can make positive progression. </p>
        
        <p>Love,</p>
