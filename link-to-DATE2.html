안녕 하세요~~ (Annyeong haseyooooo, Helloooooo)

I heard they are dropping season 4 of the Chosen! If you havent watched, I recommend watching! 
If you could have seen one of Jesus Christ's miracles in person, which one would you want to see?

This week Nevers 장로님 (Janglonim, Elder) 하고 (hago, and) I went door knocking (I am very grateful that we found people to talk to 하고 (hago, and) didn't get electrocuted from all the live wires lying around.), 길 즌도 (gir jeundo, street contacting), 하고 (hago, and) Christmas carolying proselyting! While street contacting I was able to share a scripture with someone we meet crossing the street! Then while Christmas Carolying, a member brought us hot chocolate!

Today was our Christmas P day! I got to play volleyball, make a gingerbread house, play table tennis 하고 (hago, and) watch amazing talents performed during a talent show! The winner did an Indian Hula Hoop dance. So amazing to watch! 

Helaman 14:3, Samuel the Lamanite fortells of Jesus Christ's birth! I know that I can feel joy through giving freely to others to experience the true meaning of Christmas! Jesus Christ was the perfect example of giving without asking anything in return! I invite us to serve the needy; Find one in need, serve them! I promise we will find joy in serving others!

Love,
