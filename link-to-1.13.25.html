    <h2>January 13, 2025</h2>
    <p>Hello! </p>
    <p>Today I am typing to you from inside the church building on the second floor, on a couch!</p>
    <p>Yesterday was a great day! I got to hear my new companion give an introductory talk during sacrament meeting! I liked how the focus of one of the speakers messages was on the gospel of Jesus Christ! I recieved a reminder on my phone that I will be giving a seven minute talk in korean in two weeks! I felt inspired to focus on the fourth lesson of the third chapter in Preach My Gospel called Becoming a Life Long Disciple of Jesus Christ! I chose to focus on the first covenant we make; taking the name of Jesus Christ upon us! I want to focus on praying often each day! During personal study, I wanted to find a scripture, write doen a personal experience, 하고 (hago, and) find a quote from a general conference talk! I found a scripture, Alma 9:21 where Alma 하고 (hago, and) Amulek are speaking to the people in the land of Ammonihah! They say that there are many great gifts 하고 (hago, and) blessings available to us! We can recieve them by asking for them in prayer 하고 (hago, and) striving to to live righteously! I invite you to pray for another person by name for one of these gifts! I promise that as you pray sincerely aloud on your knees, continually wanting to live righteously, Heavenly Father will bless them with this gift! I know Heavenly Father loves us 하고 (hago, and) created us uniquely with talents 하고 (hago, and) gifts! I also wrote down a personal experience of how vocal prayer often has helped my prayers become more sincere! I invite you to pray aloud before going to bed this evening! I promise that you will feel peace, comfort, 하고 (hago, and) the love of God! I know Heavenly Father hears all of our prayers 하고 (hago, and) will answer them! I also found a quote I liked from a recent general conference talk by Gerrit W. Gong 장로님 (janglonim, Elder)! He talked about the importance of trials being for the benefit of our growth! I invite you to practice something that isn't your strength! I promise that as you practice, you will improve! I know that we can reach out to family, friends, 하고 (hago, and) God for help!</p>
    <p>승연 장 장로님 (Seungyeon Jang Janglonim, Elder Seungyeon Jang) 하고 (hago, and) I went to an Art Musuem this Saturday after street proslyting/contacting! Here are some fun pictures as well as a four cut I got with the 장로님들 (Janglonimdur, Elders) before transfers!</p>
