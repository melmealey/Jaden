    <h2>September 22, 2024 - First Week in the Missionary Training Center, virtually!!</h2>
    <p>Hello,</p>
    
        <p>The first week of MTC training has been awesome! They have each of us as missionaries set up with our schedule based on what District we are in. I am in the 22-D district! I have two wonderful Sisters as my teachers! There are 11 missionaries in my district! There are 7 Elders and I with 3 Sisters.</p>
        <p>Together, we get to attend classes, workshops, and participate in lots of breakout rooms!</p>
        <p>Today, I got to join a devotional. I heard from the Mission President and his wife! They were so welcoming and friendly. I am so excited to be in the MTC. I will be leaving this Wednesday!</p>
        
        <p>Starting this week, I will be writing emails on P-days since that is when I will have the opportunity to write emails.</p>
        
        <p>I hope you all are well!</p>
        
        <p>Sincerely, </p>
        
    <p>Elder Mealey</p>
